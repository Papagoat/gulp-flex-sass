# A bare bones boilerplate using Gulp, Sass. Batteries not included. It uses [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) as a task runner.

## Installation

1. Install [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Install gulp

```sh
$ npm install gulp-cli -g
$ npm install gulp -D
```
3. CD Into the working directory and install dependencies

```sh
$ cd /gulp-flex-sass
$ npm install
```

## Usage

You will need to install the [LiveReload Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) in order for livereload to work.

Start the gulp task by running the default **gulp** command from your terminal. That's it!
```sh
$ gulp
```
